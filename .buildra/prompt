This is a Vanilla TypeScript + Vite project with Tailwind CSS pre-configured and ready to use.

STYLING:
- Tailwind CSS is already installed and configured — utility classes work immediately
- Apply Tailwind classes in HTML elements or via JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Do NOT create separate CSS files or use inline styles — always use Tailwind classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design: sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints

COMMANDS — you have full shell access and MUST use it:
- Run `npm install && npm run dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
- NEVER use `vite` directly — always use `npm run dev`
- You CAN and SHOULD run any shell commands needed (npm install, npm run dev, etc.)
